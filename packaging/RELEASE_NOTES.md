## What's changed

- **In-app updates now install on Windows.** In 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 S2S closed but the update never ran. Install
  this version by hand once; later updates install from inside S2S.
- **A failed update is reported.** If an update does not install, the next start says so and offers it again.
- **The version is shown** in the bottom-right corner of the window.

## Installation

**Mac:** Open the disk image, drag S2S onto Applications, and open it from Applications. **Windows:** Run the
installer; S2S is added to the Start menu. Later versions install from inside S2S (**Help > Check for
updates**). See the [installation guide](https://github.com/xanman04/stream2soulseek/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md)
for first-launch security prompts, checksum checks and account setup.

## Known limitations

Mac live sign-in and transfers are awaiting initial user testing. The Mac app is ad hoc signed, without
Developer ID signing or notarization; Windows builds are not publisher-signed. OS security prompts are expected.
