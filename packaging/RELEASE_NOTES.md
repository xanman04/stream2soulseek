## What's changed

- Fixed Mac browser-helper signing so Qt's required entitlements are retained when opening embedded sign-in.
- Added a packaged browser startup test that runs JavaScript offline; merely importing WebEngine is no longer enough.
- Added private-state file checks during builds and a draft-first publication process.
- Simplified downloads and installation instructions.

Python, slskd and FFmpeg are included. The **Source code** archives below are for developers.
Matching `.sha256` files are available under Assets.

## Installation

**Mac:** Extract the ZIP and move S2S.app to Applications. **Windows:** Extract the whole ZIP and open
`S2S/S2S.exe`; keep its folder together. See the [installation guide](https://github.com/xanman04/stream2soulseek/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md)
for first-launch security prompts, checksum checks and account setup.

## Known limitations

Mac live sign-in and transfers are awaiting initial user testing. The Mac app is ad hoc signed, without
Developer ID signing or notarization; Windows builds are not publisher-signed. OS security prompts are expected.
